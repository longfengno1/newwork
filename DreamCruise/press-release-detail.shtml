				<h2 class="section-header">GENTING CRUISE LINES CELEBRATES INAUGURAL SAILING OF WORLD DREAM FROM SHENZHEN HOMEPORT</h2>
				<h3>Dream Cruises, Asia’s Global Cruise Line, extends its deployment to three major port cities in Greater Bay Area</h3>
				<p><strong>Shenzhen, 20 September 2018</strong> – Genting Cruise Lines celebrated the inaugural sailing of World Dream,
					Dream Cruises’ German-built, premium megaship, from the Shekou Cruise Homeport in Shenzhen on Tuesday, 18 September,
					embarking on an exhilarating journey to scenic destinations in Vietnam. This new deployment will provide guests from
					the Pearl River Delta region with a convenient and hassle-free travel option right at their doorstep.</p>
				<p>Over the next two months, World Dream will set sail on multiple cruises from Shenzhen, including 2-night weekend escapes
					with departures on September 21 and November 23, offering guests a staycation at sea, away from the hustle and bustle
					of the city, as well as a 5-night cruise departing on November 18 to Danang and Halong Bay to explore the many splendours
					of Vietnam.</p>
				<p>“With the introduction of Shenzhen as a homeport, Dream Cruises has strategically extended its deployment to three
					major cities within the Greater Pearl River Delta Bay Area,” said Mr. Thatcher Brown, President of Dream Cruises. “Going
					forward, we will continue to explore more opportunities for inter-city collaborations involving drive, rail and fly-cruise
					to propel the development of the South China cruise market to the next level. On behalf of our officers, crew and colleagues,
					we are pleased to celebrate the inaugural call of World Dream to Shenzhen. As Asia’s Global Cruise Line, we are committed
					to delivering inspirational vacations at sea, offering value, quality and unique destination experiences to our partners
					and guests from Shenzhen.”</p>
				<p>Genting Cruise Lines, through Star Cruises, was the first-ever international cruise line to homeport in Shenzhen upon
					the opening of the Shekou Cruise Homeport with SuperStar Virgo’s deployment from November 2016 to March 2017 covering
					27 voyages during this period. A modern international cruise centre located in Southern China that integrates access
					to “sea, air, land and railway”, Shekou Cruise Homeport also first welcomed Dream Cruises in June this year when Genting
					Dream made her inaugural visit during the widely acclaimed Cruise Carnival of Shenzhen.</p>
				<p>“The homeport deployment of World Dream in Shekou brings forth access to a comprehensive array of on-board experiences
					for the general public, through which the concept of cruise travel will gain wider recognition and awareness, resulting
					in a win-win situation for the people of Shenzhen and Dream Cruises,” said Mr. Wu Wei, Shekou Cruise Home Port General
					Manager. “Over the past two years, we have witnessed tremendous growth of cruise tourism in Shenzhen, which has become
					one of the leading port cities in the country. Starting with Shekou Cruise Homeport, we will create an innovative business
					model with all-in-one “ship, port, city, tourism, shopping, leisure” including shipping, port, commercial property,
					supporting infrastructure, international logistics transhipment, maritime works repairs, tourism, specialty duty free,
					and financial services etc. in one ecosystem. This will be the replicable 4.0 cruise homeport template with the ultimate
					aim of reaching international free ports.”</p>
				<p>World Dream provides guests with the highest levels of service and spacious comfort that Dream Cruises has become
					known. Featuring the finest Asian and international dining, exceptional service, enthralling entertainment and inspirational
					experiences, World Dream redefines vacation travel for guests of all ages through transformational journeys at sea.</p>
				<p>Since its launch, Dream Cruises has been recognized by the Berlitz Cruising and Cruise Guide 2018 with Genting Dream
					placing sixth in the Large Resort category and the Travel Weekly Asia Reader’s Choice Awards 2017 where Genting Dream
					was voted as the ‘Best New Ship’ and Dream Cruises rising to the top in the ‘Best Cruise Line – Entertainment’ category.</p>
				<p>Guests enjoy the highest levels of service and spacious comfort that Dream Cruises has become known, with over 70
					per cent of staterooms featuring private balconies and a selection of connecting rooms catering to extended families
					and groups.</p>
				<p>Inspirational luxury is epitomised in The Palace, the ‘ship-within-a-ship’ concept featuring 154 suites and private
					VIP facilities including its own swimming pool, spa, gym and dining venues. The luxurious atmosphere of The Palace is
					further enhanced by the meticulous, personalized service of its renowned team of Dream Butlers who are on hand to cater
					to the every whim of their guests.</p>
				<p>World Dream offers 35 restaurants and bar concepts on board, where guests indulge in the gastronomic experience of
					their dreams, such as world-class steaks and seafood platters, round-the-clock hawker foods from Southeast Asia, as
					well the world’s first Tiffany tea set at sea.</p>
				<p>For the young and the young at heart, World Dream has developed ESC Experience Lab, the largest virtual reality game
					zone and eSports arena at sea equipped with stunning simulators and interactive games that will immerse guests in adventures
					set in fantastic new realms. World Dream also hosts Asia’s first-ever laser show at sea, as well as dance parties at
					ZOUK beach club, the outdoor entertainment venue featuring a splashing pool that doubles as a dance floor. Signature
					on-board experiences for the family include a six-slide waterpark, a thrilling ropes course and zip line located 18
					decks above the sea, mini-golf and rock climbing wall.</p>
